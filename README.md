# Tilt sound

Simple web app that makes sound.

Demo:

 * Device with tilt/orientation enabled: https://tgwizard.github.io/tilt-sound/.
 * Other: https://tgwizard.github.io/tilt-sound/?mode=click.

Orientation is weird, test here: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/deviceorientationsample.html
